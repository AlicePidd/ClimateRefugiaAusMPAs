### Workflow

Earth System Model (ESM) outputs used in this study and the associated code were obtained from publicly available data nodes - Earth System Grid Federation MetaGrid (<https://esgf.nci.org.au/search>). Workflow for downloading, wrangling, and processing ESMs can be found via the <i>hotrstuff</i> package and GitHub repo (Buenafe, Schoeman, & Everett 2024) at <https://github.com/SnBuenafe/hotrstuff> .

This repo includes code to compute and plot the following metrics of climate exposure:

> Rates of decadal change in ocean climate variables

> Gradient-based thermal climate velocity

> Marine heatwave cumulative intensity

> Identifying climate refugia based on prescribed thresholds of climate exposure
