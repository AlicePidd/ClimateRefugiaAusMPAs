## Workflow

Earth System Model (ESM) outputs used in this study and the associated code were obtained from publicly available data nodes via the Earth System Grid Federation MetaGrid (<https://esgf.nci.org.au/search>). Workflow for downloading, wrangling, and processing ESMs can be followed in the <i>hotrstuff</i> package and GitHub repo (Buenafe, Schoeman, & Everett 2024) at <https://github.com/SnBuenafe/hotrstuff> .

In addition to data preparation scripts relevant to the case study region (continental Australia), this repo includes relatively generalisable code that can be used to compute and plot the following metrics of climate exposure:

> Rates of decadal change in ocean climate variables

> Gradient-based thermal climate velocity

> Marine heatwave cumulative intensity

> Identifying climate refugia based on prescribed thresholds of climate exposure

## Machine specifications

All analyses were run on a machine with the following specifications:

```         

R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31) -- "Pile of Leaves"
```
